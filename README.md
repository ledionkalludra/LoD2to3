# LoD2to3

This project visualizes a building from a CityGML (.gml) file in 3D using Python. It extracts **WallSurface** and **GroundSurface** polygons of a specific building based on its GML ID and visualizes them using matplotlib. Also this project will calculate all camera positions and vector and maps them to UTM format in 3d.
